#Printer Subroutine
**As of right now it doesn't work with:**
- Additional memory
- Immediate addressing
- Absolute addressing

The printer takes a 6 bit binary string that has the Addressing Mode and Addressing Register.
It redirects to the correct subroutine, and the correct subroutine handles printing.
Invalid modes/registers print `XX` to the screen.

#ADD:
*MC68000 Instruction Set Summary*

Bits 11-9 are the register
Bits 6-8 are the OPMODE (size and direction).
Bit 8 specifies direction.

You can not have:
`Dn + <ea> -> <ea>` where `<ea>` is a `Dn`
To do `Dn + Dn` we use the Opmode 1:
`<ea> + Dn -> Dn`

If we are using Opmode 0, bits 11-9 are the destination register; and bits 5-0 are the source.

If we are using Opmode 1, bits 11-9 are the source; and bits 5-0 are destination.

We can also look at the entire opmode (bits 8-6) if we need to know the size of the operation.

##To Print ADD:
1. Check bit 8 to see the direction.

2. If bit 8 is 0, then we look at bits 0-5 to get the source. Print the source.

3. Look at bits 9-11 to print the destination register.

4. If bit 8 is 1, we look at bits 11-9 to print the source. Print the source.

5. Look at bits 5-0 to print the destination.
