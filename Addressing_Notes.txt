#Printer Subroutine
**As of right now it doesn't work with:**
- Additional memory
- Immediate addressing
- Absolute addressing

The printer takes a 6 bit binary string that has the Addressing Mode and Addressing Register.
It redirects to the correct subroutine, and the correct subroutine handles printing.
Invalid modes/registers print `XX` to the screen.

##Notes

In A0, we move the address of the memory word we are dealing with.
Use the address of the opcode as the parameter instead of the actual data register.
Check the opcode at the address register to determine how many bytes of additional data we need to read.
If we see immediate data or absolute address, look at memory + 2 to get the memory. (Every plus 2 is a word (16 bits)).

##Questions:
- How are we printing BRA?

###Todo
- ADD Printer (maybe opcode detector handles this?)
- BRA Printer
- BCC Printer
- MOVEQ Printer
